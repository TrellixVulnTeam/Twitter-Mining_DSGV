# Twitter Usage for Disaster Management

## Goals:
The great demonstrable strength of Twitter is a crisis-detector network, enabling a crowd-sourcing process, 
1. automatic detection(detection of tweets that appear to be containing some crisis-related data),
2. aggregation(combining all of the related data and seperating the data)
3. evaluation of tweets(analyzing the data and the n getting useful inferences from it) that may point to a genuine crisis; in a way which can pick up the weak signals [raising water levels, the smell of smoke, the sensation of tremor] before they are recognised as a genuine of crisis.

This type of crowd-sourcing process can be used to prepare, warn, respond and recover the people from a possible disaster.
